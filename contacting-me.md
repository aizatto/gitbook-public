# Contacting Me

I write this for people who:

* Want to reach out to me
* Send me a LinkedIn request without a note

I don't mind connecting, but I'd like to know:

* who I'm connecting with
* that my connections are of a higher quality

My recommendations for reaching out to me:

* Please be kind, courteous.
* Introduce yourself. Tell me who you are and a bit of background about you.
* Tell me directly what you want. Be it help, advice, internship, etc. Please do not beat around the bush.
* You don't need to be formal.
* If you email me, do share your phone number, or preferred way of texting you so that we can keep conversations casual. \(WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram\)

I apologize if this appears curt, or intimidating but it helps both of us.
