# GoPro MAX

I got the GoPro MAX as my introduction into 360 cameras.

* [https://amzn.to/2X8SRRa](https://amzn.to/2X8SRRa)

It does something my iPhone/handphone camera can't. Take 360 photos/videos, and so I felt that gave me something new that I previously never really had.

Pros:

* No need to worry about:
  * framing
  * stabilization
  * horizontal leveling

Cons:

* No remote, have to use voice commands
* Remember to rest camera on its side
* iOS issues:
  * iOS doesn't support saving 360 photos/videos to the native Photos app
  * iPadOS
    *  doesn't do vertical/landscape orientation well
      * Sometimes it goes vertical, when I want landscape
  * Wish you can speed up or slow down a video
  * YouTube 90 second limit when exporting from the iOS/iPadOS app 
    * Workaround: AirDrop the file to your macOS, this will export it into an mp4 file.
    * Upload the mp4 file
  * Cannot stitch videos on iOS/iPadOS
    * Sucks when TimeWarp splits videos at 6m40sec 
* Facebook issues:
  * Cannot upload 360 from iOS
    * Works ok when uploading file from Desktop
  * PowerPano upload doesn't view in Pano
    * Doesn't work on iOS or Desktop 
* Instagram:
  * No support for 360 photos or videos
* Google Photos:
  * Doesn't handle 360 photo files

  * Doesn't properly Power Pano either
* YouTube
  * Doesn't natively support the .360 video files
  * Have to export to .mp4 and then upload
  * YouTube compression doesn't seem that good, will have to experiment
  * 90 second limit when exporting from the iOS/iPadOS app
* Memory Card
  * You need to take battery out to take the memory card out
  * May consider putting a tape on the memory card so I can yank it out
* GoPro Player \(macOS Desktop App\)
  * Cannot stitch videos together
  * 5.6k and 4k export is only available without reframing
    * 5.6k ProRes, 10min file took 22mins to render on a MacBook Pro 2017 16GB ram, 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
      * FileSize: 49.38GB
  * Reframing
    * Limits exports to either: 1080p or 720p
  * Cannot speed up videos either
* Video Mode
  * 360 @ night, walking
    * Jitters around the lights
      * No stabilization?
    * A lot of visual noise, doesn't do well in low light

  * GoPro, capture
  * GoPro, stop capture

  * GoPro, start time lapse
  * GoPro, stop time lapse

* TimeWarp
  * 360
    * 360 does not have "auto" mode
    * 10x setting
      * Not good for casual walking
    * No sound
    * Might be better to record in video mode, and then speed it up manually in an editor \(not GoPro's app\) or YouTube \(max Playback is 2x\)
      * This will at least include sound
    * Splits video at 6mins 40seconds \(400 seconds\)
      * Raw .360 file size: 4.01GB
      * AirDropped mp4 file size: 3.33GB

    * No stabilization
    * Splits video at 8mins 2 seconds \(482 seconds\)
      * Raw: 4GB
* GoPro Plus
  * If you are buying accessories, it may make sense to get GoPro Plus because you'd make back the same money
