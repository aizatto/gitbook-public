# Programming Bootcamps

In summary: I'm very skeptical of them, but then again I'm skeptical of everything.

What can someone learn in 9 weeks?

You are what you put into it, I've seen it shine for people, and I've seen it do nothing.

Concerns \(mostly with the Individuals\):

* An individual leaves a decent paying job \(MYR 5,000\), expecting the same salary after the bootcamp. You're level of experience in programming can't give you the same salary rate. Junior programming rates in Malaysia are \(MYR 2,500\).
* If you do a Ruby on Rails Bootcamp, you are most likely a "Ruby on Rails" programmer, not a "Ruby programmer". Likewise same thing for other languages/frameworks.
