This is a public braindump of all my thoughts.

Every page here is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) \(see my [commit history](https://github.com/aizatto/gitbook-public/commits/master)\) and is not written in stone. Expect content to be updated, reorganized, shuffled, archived, whatever it is, based on any learnings or life experiences that I may go through.

If you are reading this from GitHub, for a better user experience visit [https://www.aizatto.com/](https://www.aizatto.com/)

View the [Table of Contents](table-of-contents.md) to quickly see all available documents and the directory structure of this GitBook. Hopefully this can help you find something relevant to you faster.

Part of the purpose of this site is to provide quick references for myself, and other people. Document the knowledge I know, so that I can scale myself.

I also keep other public notes in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/aizatto/Public-Notes-fbcb9e6b66784c5c96b8e2a5613927b9).
