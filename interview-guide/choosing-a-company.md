# Choosing A Company

How do you decide or discover which company to join?

* If you have a company in mind, apply there
* If you not, then you have a discovery problem.
  * Look for a rocketship company
  * Look at job boards
  * Talk to recruiting agencies to shop your resume around

## Which Company?

In general:

* Join a rocket ship company

Eric Schmidt (as CEO of Google) to Sheryl Sandberg when deciding to join Google, and now COO of Facebook:

> 'If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, get on, don't ask what seat.' I tell people in their careers, ‘look for growth.’ Look for the teams that are growing quickly. Look for the companies that are doing well. Look for a place where you feel that you can have a lot of impact.”

I'm interested in companies with products I use, so I reached out to:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/about/careers)
* [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/apply/)
* [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/careers)
* Bloombuilt (for their DayOne Journaling app)

As you will be someone who is going through the job application process, you could focus on companies.

## Evaluating Companies

* How much risk are you willing to take?
* What is the company culture?
  * Do they have a work from home policy?
  * Do they allow anyone to take vacation?
* Who/what will you be learning at the company?
* Who is going to mentor you?
* What is the company's expectation of you?
