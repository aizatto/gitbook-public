# Engineering Code

## Engineers make complex systems simple

* Reduce complexity
* Becareful about increasing/introducing complexity

## Identify the funnel

## Identify each step in the funnel

## Within each step, identify the inputs, processes, and outputs

## See if the process can be broken down

## See if the process can be done in parallel

## Build tools to measure the funnel

If you can't measure it. You can't improve it.

Build it into a chart.

See [Pipelines](https://app.gitbook.com/engineering-code/pipelines/)

### Funnel Data Structure

#### Table

| Source | Destination | Time                |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1      | 2           | 2015-11-05 12:33:41 |
| 1a     | 2           |                     |
| 1b     | 2           |                     |
| 2      | 3           |                     |
| 2      | 4           |                     |

Having such a table means you can generate a graph.

## Steps can change, moved, and removed

## Steps can be parallized

## Tests, Monitoring, Alerts

Build these in.

Make it easy to do so.

## Reduce Technical Debt

Cons of Technical Debt

* Slows you down
* Slows down the team
* Harder to clean up the longer it exists
* Frustrating
  * Burns out people

Introduced as:

* Complexities
* Inconsistencies
* Non standardization
* Gotchas
* Surprises
* Patches
* Death by a thousand commits
* Poor foresight
* Poor encapsulation

> The road to hell is paved with good intentions

## Maintaining/Managing States is a PITA

Maintaining/managing states is a PITA. When there are more states to maintain, it increases the complexity of the project.

## What slows down momentum

* Processes
  * We should engineer the processes out. Automate them. That is what engineering does best.
* Communication Overhead
  * We should engineer reducing communication overhead.
* Non Reproducible Steps
  * We should engineer reproducible steps.
* Synchronous Knowledge Sharing
  * We should engineer asynchronous knowledge sharing.
